# **Credit Card Fraud :**
The aim of this system is to identity wheather a transaction is a fraud or not, thus making sure the customers of the credit card comapany are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

## **Main challenges involved in credit card fraud detection are:**

* Enormous Data is processed every day and the model build must be fast enough * to respond to the scam in time.

* Imbalanced Data i.e most of the transactions (99.8%) are not fraudulent which makes it really hard for detecting the fraudulent ones

* Data availability as the data is mostly private.

* Misclassified Data can be another major issue, as not every fraudulent transaction is caught and reported.

* Adaptive techniques used against the model by the scammers.

## **How to tackle these challenges?**

* The model used must be simple and fast enough to detect the anomaly and classify it as a fraudulent transaction as quickly as possible.
* Imbalance can be dealt with by properly using some methods.
* For protecting the privacy of the user the dimensionality of the data can be reduced.
* A more trustworthy source must be taken which double-check the data, at least for training the model.
* We can make the model simple and interpretable so that when the scammer adapts to it with just some tweaks we can have a new model up and running to deploy.

## **What will we be doing?**

We will be using classifaction to distinguish between the transactions. We will implement different models and methods then envaluate their results.
